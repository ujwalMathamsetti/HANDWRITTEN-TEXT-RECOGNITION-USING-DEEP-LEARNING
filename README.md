# HANDWRITTEN-TEXT-RECOGNITION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
Handwritten text recognition (HTR) is a technique for receiving and interpreting handwritten input from sources such as documents, touch screens, photographs, and so on. Handwritten text recognition is a form of pattern recognition. The conventional system for this recognition is based on the characteristics of hand-written work and a vast amount of prior knowledge. In recent years, the focus of research in this field has been on deep learning techniques, which have achieved impressive results. Neural Networks (NN) are highly effective at recognising handwritten structures, such as characters/symbols/numbers and words, that support automatically extracting unique features. The proposed system is used to identify writings in a variety of formats. The EMNIST (Extended Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) dataset includes handwritten text such as digits, symbols, and numbers, with a high degree of complexity. The purpose of this study is to compare the accuracy of handwritten text recognition algorithms developed by CNN and ResNet – 50. In addition, some characters may be missed during text recognition due to incorrect detection, which will be minimised. The final step of this paper is to choose the most accurate algorithm which is CNN with a training accuracy of 93.27 per cent and then deployed the CNN model in real-time development using the FLASK framework. Python programming language was utilised for the implementation of both algorithms.
